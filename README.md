PLM Lifecycle & Change Management Simulation
Overview

This project is a Java-based simulation of core Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) principles inspired by enterprise systems such as Siemens Teamcenter.

It models:

Item & Revision management

Lifecycle state machine enforcement

Controlled revision governance

Change management using ECR (Engineering Change Request) and ECO (Engineering Change Order)

Business rule validation at service layer

The objective of this project is to understand how enterprise PLM systems enforce revision control, traceability, and lifecycle discipline internally.

Core Concepts Implemented
1. Item And Item Revision

Item represents a product (constant identity).

ItemRevision represents a specific version of that product.

Released revisions cannot be modified.

Any modification requires a new revision.

This mirrors real PLM revision control logic.

2. Lifecycle State Machine

Each revision follows strict state transitions:

WORKING → IN_REVIEW → RELEASED

Enforced Rules:

Only WORKING revision can be submitted for review.

Only IN_REVIEW revision can be approved.

RELEASED revision cannot be modified.

Invalid transitions are blocked at service layer.

This simulates workflow-driven lifecycle governance.

3. Change Management (ECR → ECO)

The project enforces controlled revision creation through change management:

Raise Change Request (ECR)

Approve Change

Implement Approved Change (ECO)

Create New Revision (starts in WORKING state)

Direct revision creation after RELEASED state is blocked to ensure governance discipline.

Architecture Design

The system follows a layered architecture:

Console UI (PLMApplication)
        ↓
Service Layer
   - WorkflowService
   - ChangeManagementService
        ↓
Domain Model
   - Item
   - ItemRevision
   - LifecycleState (Enum)
        ↓
InMemoryDatabase
Design Principles Used

Separation of Concerns

Encapsulation of Business Rules

Service-Layer Validation

State Machine Pattern

Revision Traceability

All critical validation logic is enforced in the service layer to prevent bypassing rules from UI.

Key Features

Create Items and Revisions

Strict lifecycle transition validation

Prevent direct revision creation after release

Enforce change-driven revision creation

Maintain revision history per item

Clear console feedback for invalid operations

Technical Stack

Java (Core)

OOP Principles

Enum-based State Machine

In-Memory Data Store

Layered Architecture Design

Example Controlled Flow
1. Create Item
2. Create Revision A
3. Submit for Review
4. Approve (Release)
5. Raise Change Request (ECR)
6. Implement Approved Change (ECO)
7. Create Revision B
8. Submit → Approve

This ensures:

No uncontrolled modification

Complete traceability

Governance enforcement

Learning Outcome

Through this implementation, I gained practical understanding of:

Revision control strategies in PLM systems

Lifecycle state management

Change governance (ECR/ECO separation)

Service-layer business rule enforcement

Enterprise-style validation design

Future Enhancements

Replace in-memory store with relational database (JDBC/SQL)

Add REST API layer

Introduce role-based access control

Add BOM structure per revision

Add unit tests
